# Document-classification-CNN
This repo contains the code for the document classification using conv1d and using the pretrained word embedding vectors. Here we use Glove.
There are 2 model :

  1. With char embedding vector.
  2. With word embedding vector.
  
 Vectors used here are glove word vectors.
 
 Model seems to perform good in word level embedding than char level  embedding.
 however , the model format was slightly change in case of char level as of which model didnot seem to perform well.
